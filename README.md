**DecorAIte: AI for Interior Decoration**

The increasing mobility of the American population, with 25.6 million people relocating annually, underscores the challenge of transforming empty spaces into personalized homes. Current AI tools generate idealized but impractical room designs that fail to address user-specific needs. This paper presents decorAIte, a theoretical AI-based home decoration solution that leverages natural language processing, computer vision, and image composition technologies. By analyzing user-submitted room photographs and style preferences, decorAIte provides tailored, interactive design recommendations linked directly to retailers for seamless purchasing. The system integrates advanced image segmentation, object detection, and composition models to identify and position furniture from real world catalogs accurately. We use user studies to affirm the feasibility of this approach, with future enhancements aimed at expanding the product database, optimizing image composition, and improving object recognition accuracy.
